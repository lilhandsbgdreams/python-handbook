    <h1>Python Beginner's Handbook</h1>
    <p>This "handbook" is meant as a supplemental resource for anyone
    starting to learn Python programming. The topics covered
    herein are meant for:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>self-learners</li>
       <li>students (particularly those in a first-year college course for Python)</li>
       <li>those learning for fun or to make a career change</li>
       <li><b>anyone learning programming basics through Python version 3</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>To make the most of this handbook, readers should have access to
     a computer that has the Python interpreter installed on it, and they
     should have access to other learning materials, curriculum, or
     instructors to act as primary guides for their learning.</p>
     <p>Hopefully this site will help you take the first bold steps along
     a very rewarding path.</p>

      <li><b>Instructions</b> covers some common tasks that beginning students might be asked to complete. </li>
      <li><b>Quick Reference</b> offers tables and lists for those moments when you need to quickly find information about things such as built-in functions, methods to use with lists, syntax rules, variable naming rules, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
